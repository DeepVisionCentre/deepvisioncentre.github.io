This repository is designed to document and explain in-detailed analysis of data, from concepts like mining or transforming to predictive analytics. The focus will be around

## Quick Startes Guide

* Setup `jekyll` and `Ruby` onto your local machine. Also, install all _bundler_ related dependencies beforehand with `install bundle` command for the default jekyll theme.
* Open terminal in the present working local website directory. For running jekyll type `bundle exec jekyll serve --watch` and `ctrl+c` to stop it. The `--watch` argument dynamically publishes the changes in the running website instance.
  * Also, jekyll process can be killed with following command `ps aux |grep jekyll |awk '{print $2}' | xargs kill -9` if needed.
* Only contributions to content are welcomed now, for that simply edit _index.md_ file according to your changes. Also markdown, editing help is provided in the ![contribution guide](CONTRIBUTING.md).
